#iostream


	>>> Datatypes

void   (nothing)
bool   (1 byte)
char   (1 byte)
int   (4 bytes)
float   (4 bytes)
double   (8 bytes)
std::string   (24 bytes)


	>>> Datatype Modifiers

signed int   (by default, every variable is signed, meaning that it can be positive or negative)
unsigned int   (the variable will never be negative, and its value can be higher than the signed int)
short   (cuts the memory space of the variable by half [short int will have 2 bytes])
long   (doubles the memory space of the variable [long int will have 8 bytes])
const   (a variable designed to not be changed, saving memory costs)


	>>> Relational Operators

> greater than
< less than
>= greater or equal than
<= less or equal than
== is equal to   (= is the assignment operator!)
!= is not equal to
! "not" operator


	>>> Statements

if, if-else, if-else-if...


	>>> Functions

Every function must be written immediatly above the "int main()" function!
Otherwise (if the function implementation is written below the "int main()"),
the same function must be declared above "int main()" (requiring more lines of code).
